💰 1. Crypto Liquidity Analysis & Forecasting

(PW Skills Project)

A robust financial project involving time-series forecasting, market pattern analysis, and interactive data visualization.

Objective: Analyze cryptocurrency market liquidity patterns and trends to build predictive models for liquidity forecasting.

Key Techniques: Time-series analysis, LSTM/ARIMA modeling, blockchain transaction data processing.

Outcome: Created interactive dashboards (e.g., using Streamlit/Plotly) for real-time monitoring and actionable market insights.

Repository: Crypto Liquidity Analysis

🏦 2. Bank Customer Churn Prediction

(bank_churn_new Repository)

A classic machine learning problem focused on customer retention, involving significant data preprocessing and model optimization.

Objective: Predict which bank customers are likely to churn (leave) using demographic and transactional data.

Key Techniques: Feature engineering, handling imbalanced data (SMOTE), classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Outcome: Deployed a highly accurate predictive model to identify at-risk customers, allowing the bank to implement targeted retention strategies.

Repository: Bank Customer Churn Prediction
